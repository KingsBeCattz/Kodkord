import { LinkCard, CardGrid, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Kodkord has designated guides, both to the core package, i.e. `kodkord` and to the classes package, i.e. `@kodkord/classes`.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Core Guide"
    href="/guide/core/introduction/"
    description="See the guide of all Kodkord Core"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Classes Guide"
    href="/guide/classes/introduction/"
    description="See the guide of all Kodkord Classes"
  />
</CardGrid>

<Aside>
  Due to the fact that the development version changes continuously, either small changes or braking changes, we will not make a guide, we recommend that you read the reference.
