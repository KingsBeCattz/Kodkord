Represents a single shard for handling Discord Gateway connections.

The Shard class manages an individual connection to Discord's Gateway for a specific
subset of guilds, based on Discord's sharding mechanism. It encapsulates the lifecycle
of the WebSocket connection, including connection, disconnection, and error handling.

## Constructors

### new Shard()

```ts
new Shard(
   client, 
   id, 
   settings?): Shard
```

Defined in: kodkord-dev/lib/index.d.ts:309

Creates a new Shard instance.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `client` | [`Client`](/api/core/dev/classes/client/) | The parent client responsible for creating this shard. |
| `id` | `number` | The Id of the shard. |
| `settings`? | `Partial`\<[`WebSocketSettings`](/api/core/dev/interfaces/websocketsettings/)\> | Optional shard-specific settings that override the client's default WebSocket settings. |

#### Returns

[`Shard`](/api/core/dev/classes/shard/)

## Properties

### websocket

```ts
readonly websocket: WebSocket;
```

Defined in: kodkord-dev/lib/index.d.ts:289

The WebSocket instance responsible for managing the Gateway connection.

### client

```ts
readonly client: Client;
```

Defined in: kodkord-dev/lib/index.d.ts:291

```ts
get rest(): Rest
```

Defined in: kodkord-dev/lib/index.d.ts:345

Returns the REST client associated with this shard.

This provides access to the client's REST interface for making API requests.

##### Returns

[`Rest`](/api/core/dev/classes/rest/)

The REST client instance from the parent client.

## Methods

### calculateId()

```ts
static calculateId(guildId, shards): number
```

Defined in: kodkord-dev/lib/index.d.ts:301

Calculates the shard Id for a given guild based on Discord's sharding formula.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `guildId` | `string` | The Id of the guild as a string. |
| `shards` | `number` | The total number of shards. |

#### Returns

`number`

The shard Id that is responsible for the given guild.

***

### connect()

```ts
connect(): void
```

Defined in: kodkord-dev/lib/index.d.ts:316

Connects the shard to Discord's Gateway.

- If the shard is already connected, logs a warning and does nothing.
- Otherwise, attempts to establish a connection and logs the status.

#### Returns

`void`

***

### disconnect()

```ts
disconnect(): void
```

Defined in: kodkord-dev/lib/index.d.ts:323

Disconnects the shard from Discord's Gateway.

- If the shard is not connected, logs a warning and does nothing.
- Otherwise, attempts to cleanly close the connection and logs the status.

#### Returns

`void`

***

### send()

```ts
send(message, force?): void
```

Defined in: kodkord-dev/lib/index.d.ts:337

Sends a message to the Discord gateway. Handles automatic reconnection if the shard is disconnected.

- If the shard is connected, the message is sent directly.
- Otherwise, it logs a warning and attempts reconnection if
  the `force` parameter is set to `true`.
- If reconnection fails, it logs a warning with details of the failure.

The token is masked in trace logs to ensure sensitive information is not exposed.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `message` | `GatewaySendPayload` | The payload to send to the Discord gateway. |
| `force`? | `boolean` | Whether to attempt reconnection and resend the message if the shard is disconnected. |

#### Returns

`void`
