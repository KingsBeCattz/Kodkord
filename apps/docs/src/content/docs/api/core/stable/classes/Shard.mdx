Represents a single shard for handling Discord Gateway connections.

The Shard class manages an individual connection to Discord's Gateway for a specific
subset of guilds, based on Discord's sharding mechanism. It encapsulates the lifecycle
of the WebSocket connection, including connection, disconnection, and error handling.
